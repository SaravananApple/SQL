Constraints

To set the rules for the column we can use Constraints

Primary key
Foreign key
Not null
Unique
Check

Primary key

Primary key is an entity integrity
it cannot allow duplicate values
it cannot allow null values
in one table only one primary key can be used

Foreign key

foreign key is an referential integrity
it allow duplicate values
it allow null values
in one table multiple foreign key can be used

Unique

It is an Unique integrity
it cannot allow duplicate values
it allow null values


create table e_Course(C_id number primary key,C_name varchar2(30) not null)

insert into e_Course values(105,'EEE')


create table c_stu(
s_id number,
s_name varchar2(30),
s_phone number,
s_email varchar2(50),
s_cid number,
Constraints primary primary key(s_id),
Constraints nn not null(s_name), 
Constraints ck_id check(length(s_phone)=10),
Constraints un_id unique(s_email),
Constraints fk_id foreign key (s_cid) references C_Course(C_id)
)
